"Spotify Sort Explicit and Non-Explicit Songs" is a pair of Python scripts designed to help you manage your Spotify playlists effortlessly. These scripts use the Spotify API to create two distinct playlists: one for songs with explicit content and another for non-explicit ones.

How to Use:

Non-Explicit Playlist:

Open the "NonExplicit.py" script.
Replace "your_client_id," "your_client_secret," and "your_redirect_uri" with your Spotify app credentials.
Specify the name of the playlist containing your songs.
Run the script to create a new playlist with only non-explicit songs.

Explicit Playlist:

Open the "Explicit.py" script.
Replace "your_client_id," "your_client_secret," and "your_redirect_uri" with your Spotify app credentials.
Specify the name of the playlist containing your songs.
Run the script to create a new playlist with only explicit songs.

Tips:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Make sure your Spotify app has the necessary permissions.
Any issues? Check Spotify API status and update your credentials.
Have fun enjoying your curated playlists!
